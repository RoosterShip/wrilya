# Project Wrilya

Community Oriented Game (COG)

## Running the Project

Assuming you have all the needed software installed

`make run`

Will launch everything needed to start developing.

## Licensing

GPLv3. See [COPYING](COPYING.md) for the full text.

### Why GPLv3 instead of MIT

Part of what we wanted to do with this project is make it community owned and the development process transparent. So to do that we are starting off with a GPLv3 license but if the community decides to make it MIT/Appache/etc they can vote on it.
